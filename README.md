This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning-based stress detection system. The system leverages advanced techniques to analyze physiological and behavioral data, accurately predicting stress levels and providing personalized recommendations.
Data
Raw Data: Contains the raw physiological and behavioral data collected from various sources.
Processed Data: Contains the preprocessed and engineered data ready for model training.
Models
Trained Models: Stores the trained machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks).
Source Code
Data Preprocessing: Handles data cleaning, normalization, and imputation.
Feature Engineering: Extracts relevant features from raw data.
Model Training: Trains and evaluates machine learning models.
App: Implements the web or mobile application for user interaction.
Results
Model Performance: Stores evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
User Feedback: Collects user feedback and insights.
Requirements
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow/PyTorch (optional)
Flask/Django/Streamlit (for web app)
